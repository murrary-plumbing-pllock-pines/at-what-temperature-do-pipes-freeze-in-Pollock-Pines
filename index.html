      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section>
        <p>Pipes in Pollock Pines are susceptible to freezing when temperatures drop to 32°F (0°C) or lower. Due to the area's elevation and harsh winters, understanding how to prevent frozen pipes is crucial for both residential and commercial plumbing systems.</p>
        <p>Freezing pipes can lead to serious damage, such as burst pipes and water flooding, which is why it's essential to know the factors that contribute to pipe freezing and the methods to prevent it.</p>

      <!-- KEY TERMINOLOGY -->
      <section>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frozen Pipes</dt>
          <dd>Water pipes that freeze when the water inside them reaches freezing temperatures, causing the water to expand and the pipe to potentially burst.</dd>

          <dt>Insulation</dt>
          <dd>The material used to protect pipes from freezing by maintaining a higher internal temperature, particularly in unheated areas like attics and basements.</dd>

          <dt>Hydro Jetting</dt>
          <dd>A method used to clear clogged pipes and restore proper flow by using high-pressure water.</dd>

          <dt>Trenchless Technology</dt>
          <dd>A modern plumbing technique that allows for repairs or replacements of pipes with minimal digging and disruption to the property.</dd>

      <!-- PROCESS & DIAGNOSTICS -->
      <section>
        <p>To prevent pipes from freezing, it's important to understand how the freezing process works. When temperatures drop, water inside pipes freezes and expands, leading to pressure buildup that can eventually cause pipes to burst. It’s vital to identify vulnerable pipes, especially in uninsulated areas, to mitigate the risk of freezing.</p>

      <!-- TECHNICAL STANDARDS & LOCAL CONTEXT -->
      <section>
        <p>In Pollock Pines, local building codes and standards require that plumbing systems be adequately insulated to prevent freezing during winter months. For more detailed guidance on water and sewer infrastructure, refer to the official standards published by the <a href="https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Community-Development/Building">City of Sacramento Building Services</a>.</p>
